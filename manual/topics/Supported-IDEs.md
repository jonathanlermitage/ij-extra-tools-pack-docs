These IDEs are currently supported for versions from 2024.3 to their latest stable version.  

> Older versions of Extra Tools Pack, Extra Icons, Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons and Extra IDE Tweaks are compatible with IDEs from 2020.3, but they're no longer supported.

> <tooltip term="EAP">EAP</tooltip> IDE snapshots are also supported. Please understand that EAP IDEs are subject to breaking changes by nature, which may break plugins as well. I usually do my best to support the latest EAP snapshots with minimal delay. In practice, it should work most of the time.

> Please note that JetBrains Gateway and other remote IDEs based on the JetBrains Client (like Gitpod) are currently NOT supported.
> I have plans to support remote IDEs, but JetBrains has to resolve some major issues first. Unfortunately, there is no <tooltip term="ETA">ETA</tooltip> from JetBrains.
