# Ask me New Icons

I regularly rework and add new icons, but I would be pleased to know if there are some new icons you would need.

To proceed:

- [open an issue](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-toolwindow-colorful-icons-pub/issues). [Example](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-toolwindow-colorful-icons-pub/issues/4).
- or, email me.

I will do my best to add the desired new icons in the next plugin release.
