# Ask me New Icons

I regularly rework and add new icons, but I would be pleased to know if there are some new icons you would need.

To proceed:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-icons-plugin/issues). [Example](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-icons-plugin/issues/191).
- Or, email me at *jonathan.lermitage AT gmail.com*.

I will do my best to add the desired new icons in the next plugin release.
