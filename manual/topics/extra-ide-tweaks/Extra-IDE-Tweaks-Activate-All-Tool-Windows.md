> The `Run`, `Debug`, `Profile`, and `Find` tool windows are not considered as "available" tool windows.  
> This is a limitation of the IDE. This makes sense as these tool windows show content only after specific user interactions. For example, the `Run` tool window shows content only if you ran a Run configuration or a program. In this situation, this tool window is activated automatically. There is no reason to activate it when empty.
