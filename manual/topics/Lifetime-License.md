## Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons

Lifetime licenses of Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons can be acquired via this separate plugin: [Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons **Lifetime**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26404-extra-toolwindow-colorful-icons-lifetime/pricing#personal). It is like Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons, with a lifetime license.

> There are two different plugins because JetBrains does not allow plugin developers to offer all the license types (monthly/yearly and lifetime) for the same plugin. Both plugins offer the exact same features. The only difference is the license.

I'm working on this ðŸ˜‰

## Extra Icons and Extra Tools Pack

There are no lifetime licenses for Extra Icons and Extra Tools Pack at the moment. Lifetime licenses for Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons are very new (they've been introduced on Jan 25, 2025), and I'm still observing users' reactions and their impact on sales. I may enable lifetime licenses for more plugins later, but there is no <tooltip term="ETA">ETA</tooltip>.
