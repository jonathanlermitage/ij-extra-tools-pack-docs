# Extra Tools Pack

> WORK IN PROGRESS
{style="warning"}

Extra Tools Pack is a plugin for JetBrains IDEs that offers the exact same features as these three plugins: Extra Icons, Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons, and Extra IDE Tweaks.

See their respective documentation:

* [Extra Icons](Extra-Icons.md)
* [Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons](Extra-TCI.md)
* [Extra IDE Tweaks](Extra-IDE-Tweaks.md)

## How It Works

Extra Tools Pack repacks these three plugins into a new single package.
That means you will continue to access to their features like:
* <ui-path>File | Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Extra Icons</ui-path> settings panel
* <ui-path>File | Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Extra ToolWindow Colorful Icons</ui-path> settings panel
* <ui-path>File | Settings | Tools | Extra IDE Tweaks</ui-path> settings panel
* <ui-path>Tools | Extra IDE Tweaks</ui-path> and <ui-path>Tools | Plugins</ui-path> menu items
* context-menu entries
* information and confirmation dialogs
* and all the other features

> This is similar to installing these plugins individually. The only differences are that with Extra Tools Pack, you will install a single plugin file, and you will acquire a single license at a [reduced price](Purchase-a-License.md#extra-tools-pack).

> You won't lose your plugin configuration when migrating to Extra Tools Pack. It uses the same configuration files.
